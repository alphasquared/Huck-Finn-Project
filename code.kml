        <description><![CDATA[Chapter 1: The town where the novel begins is St. Petersburg, which is a fictional place based on Twain's boyhood town of Hannibal, MO. The present-day Hannibal has made a museum of Twain's boyhood home, and has a riverboat tour that points out Jackson's Island. Here is another map (http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=106763612444785450208.00044262e3a4dbbf5bc21&ll=40.128491,-90.351562&spn=11.552871,20.01709&z=6&om=1) of the town.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Chapter 7: Huck camps for several days on this island and meets Jim there. They find a raft, investigate a floating house, and head downriver. This island is credited in an 1899 article (http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/tomsawye/nostalgia/99harpers.html) as being the inspiration for Twain's Jackson's Island. Tours on the Mark Twain Riverboat (http://www.marktwainriverboat.com/) also name this as Jackson's Island. The text states that "... the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile<br>wide." Erosion has probably changed the shape of the island.]]></description>
